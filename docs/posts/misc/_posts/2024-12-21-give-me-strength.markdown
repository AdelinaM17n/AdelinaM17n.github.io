What's a blog without a post that documents the author's deteriorating mental healthy? Nothing Obviously.

The date is 09/09/2024 (09/09/2024 for Americans), 
After about a week of messing around, I am finally finishing in on a working proto-type of my new phonetic input method for Sinhalese. Hours feels like minutes as I am finalizing the input scheme, and as I get closer and closer to the finish line, I begin to ponder what would be the first thing I'd type with the finished prototype. Then it hits me, *අක්කා*, older-sister in Sinhalese. 
   
She'd be the first one to see this in action, and realistically, the only one I could show this to among people I know that could fully appreciate what it is to the fullest.   

And the moment of truth attrives, I run the program, and hit the keys `a` `k` `k` `a` `a`, and it outputs `අක්කා`, without any issues or hiccups. A sense of relief and happiness fills me as I call out to my sister.
The ensuing conversation goes as follows, roughly translated from Sinhala to English.
> Her : What's up?   
Me : I've finally finished the keyboard thingy I've been working on for ages, I'm typing with it right now   
Her : Ok cool   
Me : Sooo, wanna see a demonstration of it?   
Her : Eh, no  
Me : Oh ok, but but wanna know what was the first word I typed with it?   
Her : ....   
Me : It was අක්කා!   
Her : Oh ok
  
Alas it was my fault, not sticking to showcasing my work to people online who don't even speak or are able to write Sinhalese was a grave mistake on my part. Had I had the ability to intergrate better with my fellow compatriots, maybe I would have had someone else to showcase it to.
   
Fast forward to few weeks after that, I am in voice channel, accompanied by two lovely people, deeply engrossed in conversation. During this conversation a certain remark, a harmless observation, a harmless remark, with no ill intentions gets made. Yet it strikes chord within me, kickstarting a breakdown that plays out at an agonizingly slow pace.   
   
Just a week before that I was awestruck by a random, mundane, inconsequential remark of a friend during a conversation we were having. She may have spent few seconds typing that message out, I doubt she even remembers that message, I don't think she could even guess the nature of it, yet it put a smile on my face for nearly a week. Thank you.
   
Fast forward to present, now go back a bit, there I am staring at the ceiling, it's been maybe an hour since I've turned off the lights. I wonder what the future holds for me, I recall what the past had in offer for me, both of those above interactions being played in my head. The things I ponder about are more serious, consequential than that. Yet those two interactions encapuslates all I feel about everything
   
There's a line that I hear often fromy my family members, "As if you've got real problems lmao", and if your only exposure to me is this post and how I present myself in public spaces you might be inclined to agree too (The closet here is spacious my dear friend, although beware of the spikes of anxiety and the isolating nature of it). I wish that were true, I want that to be true, that could be true, I have tried to have that be true. The harder I tried to pretend that the sources of problems I face are not real, the more they proved themselves to be real.
   
Three more implementations of my phonetic input method later, I am sailing through life, feeling nothing yet everything, chasing moments of delight all while trying to prevent the snowballing of the deterioration my sanity. May the coming year bring hope and strength to me.
   
Perhaps it's apt, or perhaps it ironic that I find a Sinhalese song to be the most-apt song to link in this blogpost, [අපි කවුරුද - Wayo](https://youtu.be/kG9TMaXvRW8) is a great song, give it a listen.
