*You should have recognized, it's too late for choosing sides*
  
## ‍
  
Picture this, you are born in a hyper-conservative society, it is by no means a monolith, but most people, share similar beliefs and attitudes. Now imagine that, you, by various means, have been exposed to more progressive values and you are starting starting to realize that everyone around you holds beliefs and attitudes that are fundementally bigoted, and contrary what appears as moral to you. Everyone you know, your parents, sibilings, friends, relatives, and that person who was randomly nice to you, they all share those same beliefs.   
   
What would you do? None of these people have ever done *you* any wrong, and yet now you are left to come to terms with the fact that that they hold beliefs which you are increasingly finding to be worthy of moral condemnation.   

Can you handle it? Or would you employ cognitive dissonance to hide these thoughts under clouds of bliss?   
   
Is it even worth it to you to have to look at all who you knew and loved in a tainted light?    
   
***Well I sure fucking hope so.***

## Hypothetical no more
I come from Sri Lanka, from a hyper-conservative Sinhala-Buddhist community. A community where ethno-nationalism is the norm. I can count with my fingers on my hand the number of people I know here who are not homophobic. Queerness has and continues to run through my vein; There has not been an age or a period where I felt as I fit in. Trust was not, is not, and has never been an option for me.
   
In grade 11, during the an English Literature lesson, our teacher began to talk about the author of the literary work we were discussing (The Wave, Sonali Deraniyagalage). The author, who now resides in New York and London, had entered lesbian marriage in 2018 with a high-profile actress. The teacher was seemingly accepting of her marriage, and followed up with a statement which could be roughly translated as follows,   
> "So like we don't have this here, but it's a normal part of their culture and it's ok ***there***"
   
It was comforting to know that her acceptance was dependant on where or not my existence caused a major nuissance to the cultural zeitgesit that I resided in.
   
The Sri Lankan diaspora is vast, spread across the whole world, and diverse. Being from a Sinhalese background, I mainly have only really interacted with people from the Sinhalese diaspora. This form of vulgar cultural relativism is a thing employed by many of them. Perhaps it's their way of navigating being stuck between two cultures. It still cuts me the same.
   
*Two Faced, Caught in the Middle*

## You know how to keep your mouth shut, I know not to trust you
Many people from various backgrounds employ such strategies of vulgar cultural relativism and coginitive dissonance to interact with communities and people who may be more (or less) tolerant than them. ~~Some people who sincerely and without inner-conflict hold those bigoted beliefs know when to keep their fucking mouths shut. I am certainly not ungrateful of their efforts to restrain themselves from expressing dissatisfaction with my existence.~~   

Yet I can recognize this, I can recognize *you* from a mile away. This makes every interaction I have with *you* feel hollow. Would *you* have treated me with the same kindness and warmth had we met under different circumstances? The feelings that I experience do not differ much from those I experience when I am treated kindly by people purely because they were ignorant of my true-self.
   
The human experience is a varied and complicated thing, I will offer you warmth and kindness but I know better than to trust you.

But believe me, son.   
I want to be what I used to be   
when I was like you. I want   
to unlearn all these muting things.   
Most of all, I want to relearn   
how to laugh, for my laugh in the mirror   
shows only my teeth like a snake’s bare fangs!

It is not by choice that I feel hollow after every social interaction I have in my day-to-day life interacting with my fellow Sri Lankans. It feels almost as if I am executing a protocol of social interaction, never able to truly connect or be vlunerable.
   
Yet I will continue riding on with the safety of masked hollowness, *Until I Can't No More*.
