> "It actually ends with a schwa, you know, like half an `a`. English just smushes together the feminine and masculine version of my name into one single spelling. But My name is the masculine version."

Those words had been akin to a mantra that I had practiced reciting a thousand times by the time I was 14. The English spelling of my first given name ended in an `a`. Anyone who read it for the first time, were they be from Sri Lanka or abroad would always naturally assume that it was a girl's name, ~~and it was, in more ways than one~~.
   
I had another second given name, one whose gender was in no way ambiguous, and was unambiguously masculine. Most people around me found that name much more *beautiful* than the other one, and most people who got to know me before I had the awareness and agency to assert myself usually preferred that name. This should have been a slam dunk right? I should have just defaulted to that name right?
   
I hated it. I'd always make sure that nobody would refer to me by that name. It felt off to me. I didn't want to have anything to do with it.

# It's Not Just The Obvious
There's an elephant in the room, you may have probably inferred it by now, but I'm transgender, a transgender woman to be precise. One would hence conclude that I hated my second given name since it was unambiguously masculine, and they'd be be correct, yet it is not the whole reason, not the only reason.
   
It annoyed me profoundly that others would try to decide how I was referred to because they themselves found a certain name to be more beautiful than the other, my wishes be damned. It was perhaps my transness that compelled me to not like that name, yet it was how others tried to interfere with my agency over my identity that made me *detest* it.
   
This second name still remains a weapon unmatched at denying me agency over myself, with people around me constantly invoking it to provoke a reaction out of me, despite me having repeatedly expressed that I wish not to be referred to by that name.
   
Their refusal to respect my wishes does not stem from transphobia. Not a single person who knows that name knows that I'm transgender, nor do I intend to tell them anytime soon.

# Wait, What About The First Name, The Schwa 'a' One
I used to assert the masculinity of my first name with a fervour unmatched. If you did not speak Sinhala, you'd have been in for a whole info-dump about the schwa vowel and how English orthography sucked, followed up by a multitude of example words to help you nail the correct pronunciation.   
Why did I do that you might wonder, especially considering that I had wholesale refused to use one name in part because it was unambiguously masculine.
   
**Self Agency**
   
I did not know I was transgender. As far as I was concerned, I was a man and had been a man. To get the name wrong, even if it gave me a *queer* feeling, was to deny me agency over my identity. ***Even if you had known that I was transgender before I myself could have known, it still would have been wrong for you to get it WRONG***

# C-could You... Uh.. Expand on That 'Queer Feeling'
Every trans person's childhood experience is different. Some go through their whole childhood completely oblivious, while others are so assured of who they are from such a young age that it feels like their gender identity is a message from the gods and that they descended upon this earth to deliver that message as soon as humanly, or divinely, possible.   
   
I've always felt awkward, off, *queer*. Yet that by itself was not enough to make me realise anything nor is it in any way indicative of transness by itself. As a child I had daydreamt a lot, I'd be lost in a world of my mind's making as I stayed stood for the religious observances that took place before classes at my school. Never had I imagined myself as a woman in those daydreams of mine, at times I'd imagine myself as something that'd almost amount to a caricature of an everyman man of society. These daydreams were more theatre than fantasy for me. I was not who I wanted to be in those dreams, rather, I was who I thought I would be, could be, should be.
   
And to be a woman was not something that I thought I could be, would be, or should be.
   
Yet as time went on, the *queer* feelings kept pilling on. I'd be eager to correct someone's pronunciation of my name, and perception of me as a woman, all while being giddy that the misperception happened in the first place. The corrections were slowly morphing into a thing I did to assert my agency over my identity, and *self*, yet it was fast becoming clear that the self I'd assumed for myself was not what my heart desired, and that there was a dissonance between my identity and what my sense of self was drifting towards.
   
# So Many Words, Not Much Meaning-
~~Stfu you bloody titles, you are but a rhetorical device. Be nicer~~
   
It's difficult to describe how I realised I was a woman, the process was like a collection of rocks being slowly eroded by waves of water, a wall being chipped away with a small chisel over a decade. When I realised the nature of these feelings I had about who I am, who I wanted to be, I aceepted them with welcome arms at first, yet as it slowly dawned on me that I was in an environment that was utterly hostile in every way towards me asserting my identity in this way, a sense of dread and anxiety so overwhelming washed through me that I could do nothing but bend my knee before this monstrous cloud of feelings. I caved in.  
 I tried my best to assert to myself that I was a man. I could not stand to live in a reality where a majour part of my identity would be rejected by those around me. I could not stand to live in a world where all those who were around me were prejudiced, perhaps bigoted, against an aspect that would and could be central to who I am.
   
Wouldn't it have been easier had  this whole thing been a ruse? I'd be able to be confident a central part of my identity would not be denied by others, and I'd be able sleep well knowing that people around me were not prejudiced or bigoted towards me, or anyone.

~~Thank fuck that questioneering title entity is gone~~
   
Some feelings are ephemeral, ~~like how I found Bas De Leede of the Dutch cricket team hot~~, others are not. No matter how many days I woke up wanting to feel like I had no doubts about my gender again, the feeling that I was not a man was not a feeling that could be decimated. Every time I interacted with someone, everytime I was aware of how I was perceived by others, every single one of those times I was reminded that I could have these thoughts fuck-off out of my head, have them drift away, yet not have them be false.
   

This blog post doesn't have an explanation or telling of a trans-experience that'd awe a transphobe or someone prejudiced against trans people into acceptance. No it's merely a structured rambling of many losely related that I'm airing out to the into the sky.
