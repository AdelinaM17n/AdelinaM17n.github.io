Heyo, I am Adelina! I happen to be from the small island of Sri Lanka, But in the land of the internet we're all citizens of the internet aren't we? I am a native speaker of the Sinhala language but these days the English language has taken over most parts of my life.

Most of the posts that I plan on posting here will be written in English, but some of the them might get a Sinhalese version. I have a lot of interests which drift away and come back with time, so don't expect a consistent theme with what I would post here :P

If you'd like to learn more about *me*, then go take a look at the [About]({% link about.markdown %}) page.
